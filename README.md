# vikdal

A Dalvik bytecode disassembler, code graph generator and decompiler.

It can read .dex and .apk files.

:warning: This is a work in progress. In particular, decompilation does not
work yet.

## Build

The project is split into a core library and code graph browser.

Both can be built with Maven:

```
mvn package
```

This will produce .jar files in `core/target` and `browser/target`.
Unfortunately, the JGraphX dependency used by the browser is not actively
maintained and not available on Maven Central. Version 2.1.0.7 is included
with vikdal and will be compiled into the standalone jar automatically.

Possible replacements are being investigated.

## Run

The browser can then be run with:

```
java -jar browser/target/vikdal-browser-0.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

Aside from unit tests, there are also some examples in `core/test/java`.
