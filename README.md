# vikdal

A Dalvik bytecode disassembler, code graph generator and decompiler.

It can read .dex and .apk files.

:warning: This is a work in progress. In particular, decompilation does not
work yet.

## Build

Compile all Java sources in src/ and test/ .

You need the JgraphT, JGraphX, AntLR and JavaParser libraries.

A Maven build file is provided, but JGraphX is missing because upstream does
not upload builds to Maven Central. The .jar must be obtained elsewhere.

## Run

There are a few example applications in test/ .

To get started, run ch.seto.vikdal.browser.Browser - this is a graphical code
browser that nicely visualises code graphs of individual functions.
